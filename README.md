# Visualization for Faceted Exploration of Patient Similarity (SimVis)

Identifying similar entities (e.g., products, students, customers) is a pervasive data analysis 
problem. In the case of electronic health record data, a key task is to identify patient 
groups/cohorts based on multiple facets: medications taken, procedures undergone, 
demographic characteristics, etc. This task can ultimately help in targeted drug discovery 
(what types of drugs are suitable for which groups of patients) or even identifying potential 
causal factors behind complex health conditions.

## Goal:
Help users visually identify similar patients, interpret the features that cause them to be 
similar within a group
